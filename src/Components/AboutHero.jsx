            Ä°nnovation in Agriculture with Orbiba Robotics
          </h2>
          <p>
            Orbiba stands for "an organic bond" motto. Our basic philosophy is
            the idea of "People become what they eat". We believe that the
            cleaner the basic foods that sustain a person's life, the cleaner
            his body, spiritual and intellectual development will be.
            <br />
            <br /> Orbiba Robotics is an agriculture teknoloji startup that we
            established to produce affordable robot platforms that process data
            with AI for every individual who wants to contribute in the field of
            clean agriculture.
            <br />
            <br /> With this initiative, we want to support organic agriculture
            practitioners who take the initiative to solve the problem of access
            to safe food, the awareness of which is increasing day by day in the
            world, with smart small robots that we will design and develop, with
            minimal carbon footprint, using renewable energy, low cost and high
            return on investment.
            <br />
            <br /> While providing this support, we aim to provide solutions in
            line with new technological developments by discussing the
            difficulties experienced in organic agriculture with our relevant
            stakeholders.
